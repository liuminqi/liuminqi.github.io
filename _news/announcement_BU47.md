I gave a talk on *Intervention effects in Mandarin-speaking childrenâ€™s comprehension of passives* at the 47th Boston University Conference on Language Development ([BUCLD](https://www.bu.edu/bucld/) 47) with [Victoria Mateu](https://www.victoriamateu.com) and [Nina Hyams](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/person/nina-hyams/). I   received a Paula Menyuk Travel Award ($350) for this trip. Here are <a href="/assets/pdf/Liu_BUCLD47_slides.pdf" target="_new">our slides</a> and a pre-print version of our <a href="/assets/pdf/Liu_Mateu_Hyams_BUCLD47.pdf" target="_new">conference paper</a>.
