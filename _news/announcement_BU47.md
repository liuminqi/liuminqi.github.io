I will give a talk on *Intervention effects in Mandarin-speaking childrenâ€™s comprehension of passives* at the 47th Boston University Conference on Language Development ([BUCLD](https://www.bu.edu/bucld/) 47) with Victoria Mateu and Nina Hyams in November 2022. I have  received a Paula Menyuk Travel Award ($350) for this trip.
