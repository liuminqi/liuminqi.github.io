I'm a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="/https://linguistics.ucla.edu" target="_new">Department of Linguistics</a> at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and also a member of the <a href="/https://languagelab.humanities.ucla.edu" target="_new">UCLA Language Acquisition Lab</a>. I am primarily interested in __first language acquisition__ and __theoretical syntax__. My dissertation project centers on the syntax and acquisition of passive constructions in Mandarin Chinese. 


My work employs experimental methods to address core issues in children's syntactic development. My recent research concerns how children acquire the syntactic constructions that involve extraction of a nominal phrase over another c-commanding nominal phrase, which usually triggers locality difficulties in child languages ('Intervention Effects').



Besides Mandarin, I have also worked on San Crist√≥bal Lachirioag Zapotec, an underdocumented language spoken in Oaxaca in south-western Mexico, and Tonggu Gan, a non-Mandarin Chinese dialect spoken in Jiangxi in south China.

Before entering the PhD program at UCLA, I earned my B.A. in Chinese Linguistics at <a href="/https://english.pku.edu.cn" target="_new">Peking University</a>, China.
