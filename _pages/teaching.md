__Ling 130 -- Language Development__ (Summer 2020 __Syllabus__: <a href="/assets/pdf/Ling130_syllabus.pdf" target="_new">PDF</a>)

<ins>Description</ins>: This course was concerned with the question of how children naturally acquire their native languages. The primary focus was on children’s development of grammatical knowledge and the various stages that they pass through on the way to adult competence. We  looked at development in the various components of grammar -- phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics/pragmatics and we  also discussed some theories of language development. The students were introduced to child language data -- what children perceive, say, and comprehend in the course of development -- and learned how to analyze that data. We  also looked at language acquisition in English and other languages, and in special populations and circumstances (e.g. bilingualism, L1 acquisition beyond the “critical period”).
<br><br>
<ins>Responsibilities</ins>: Course design, lectures (6h/week), discussion section (1h/week), office hours (2h/week), advising students on their final research projects, hosting a mini-conference for students to present their research projects, and grading homework and final papers.
