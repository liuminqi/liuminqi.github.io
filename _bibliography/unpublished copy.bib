  abstract = {This thesis investigates the verbal morphology of Lachirioag Zapotec, a Northern Zapotec language from the town of San Cristóbal Lachirioag in Oaxaca, Mexico. There are two parts of the verbal morphology that are the focus of this thesis, the TAM prefixes and the argument enclitics. There are two kinds of TAM prefix{:} primary prefixes, which are obligatory, and secondary prefixes, which are not. The first part of the thesis centers around the primary prefixes and their use, with a focus on the allomorphy exhibited by the perfective and irrealis prefixes. The second part of the thesis discusses the secondary prefixes and the information that they convey. Finally, the third part focuses on the argument enclitics and plural marker, specifically on their distribution and cooccurrence restrictions.},
